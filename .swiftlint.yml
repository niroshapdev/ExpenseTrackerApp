# By default, SwiftLint uses a set of sensible default rules you can adjust:
disabled_rules: # rule identifiers turned on by default to exclude from running
  - colon
  - comma
  - control_statement
  - trailing_whitespace

excluded: # case-sensitive paths to ignore during linting. Takes precedence over `included`
  - Carthage
  - Pods
  - Sources/ExcludedFolder
  - Sources/ExcludedFile.swift
  - Sources/*/ExcludedFile.swift # exclude files with a wildcard
